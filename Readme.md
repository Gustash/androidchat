# Real-time Android group chat #

## Summary ##
I wanted to learn how to code native Android applications, so I decided to use [Realtime Framework](http://framework.realtime.co/messaging) to build a real-time group chat. It was pretty simple!

You start by defining your nickname:

(insert nickwindow picture)

Then you are brought to a window with a list of channels, to which you can connect based on your preferred theme:

(insert channelselection image)

After selecting the channel you can start chatting with all the other users that are connected to the same group:

(insert chatwindow image)

You can even check who is currently active in that channel (using the [Realtime Framework Presence Service](http://messaging-public.realtime.co/documentation/starting-guide/presence.html)):

## Building your own chat ##

To use this code to build your own chat we just need to [register for a free account at the Realtime website](https://accounts.realtime.co/signup/) and enter your credentials into the source code.
